Q: Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
A: The app I developed was a weight tracking tool designed to help users easily monitor their weight. The goal was to create a straightforward, user-friendly app that allows users to record and view their weight progress over time. It was aimed at addressing the need for a simple and effective way to track weight changes, which is important for those focusing on health and fitness goals.

Q: What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A: Essential screens included a home screen for inputting weight, a history screen to view past entries, and settings for customization. The UI was designed with simplicity in mind, using large, clear buttons and an easy-to-navigate layout. This approach made the app accessible, even for users not tech-savvy, contributing to the design's success.

Q: How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
A: The coding process was methodical. I started with the basic functionality, like data input and retrieval, then moved on to more complex features. Regular code reviews and refactoring kept the codebase clean and maintainable. This approach, focusing first on core functions and then expanding, is versatile and can be applied to future projects.

Q: How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
A: I used a combination of unit testing and manual testing. This ensured not only that individual parts of the code worked correctly but also that the app as a whole functioned as expected. Testing is crucial as it reveals bugs and usability issues that can be overlooked during development. It highlighted areas where the user experience could be improved.

Q: Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A: A significant challenge was managing user data effectively. I innovated by implementing a robust database system that was both efficient and secure. This required learning new database management techniques and ensuring seamless integration with the app's front end.

Q: In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
A: The most successful component was the data management system. It demonstrated my ability to handle complex back-end development and create an interface that made data interaction seamless for the user. Balancing the technical aspects with user-friendly design was a significant achievement of this project.
