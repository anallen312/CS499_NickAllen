# CS210 Project 2
Investment calculator project.

Purpose:

This program takes the users details about their initial investments, 
what they want to deposit monthly, the interest rate, and the length of time in years
to show them how their investment will grow over that length of time. One output
screen shows what the investments will look like with monthly deposits, the other shows
what they will look like over the same length without those deposits.

Q&A:

What did you do particularly well?

Im fairly proud of how ive encapsulated my methods into a seperate class. I'm by no means anywhere close to expert level, but I think its a good start toward becoming a better object oriented programmer.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could probably seperate my methods even further, into more classes so they can be re-used easier.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The part I found most challenging was trying to get the financial logic correct for both the case including, and excluding monthly deposits. In hindsight, its simple, but it felt like doing math in a different language which was difficult for my brain to wrap itself around. Also finding the resources to be able to print the results to a table took more time than I thought. For both of these problems, i combed through previous zybooks readings and Stack Overflow pretty thoroughly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

All of the OOP priciples used in the project. Being able to make your code easy to read and update as needed seems like it will be very valuable in the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Lots of comments, a bit of abstraction when it comes to the class with the calculator in it, and encapsulating all of my data with my methods in a seperate class.
