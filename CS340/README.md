**Q: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

A: Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires clear, concise code, often achieved through consistent naming conventions, code modularization, and thorough documentation. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, these practices allowed for easy updates and debugging, which facilitated the connection to dashboard widgets in Project Two. This modularity and documentation make the codebase easier to understand and modify, leading to significant advantages in adaptability and maintenance.

**Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

A: As a computer scientist, my approach to solving problems, like the database or dashboard requirements from Grazioso Salvare, involves understanding the problem domain, devising algorithms, and iterating over solutions. Compared to previous assignments, this project required integrating various technologies and tools, which necessitated a comprehensive design and implementation strategy. For future database creation to meet client needs, I would use a systematic approach that includes requirement analysis, design modeling, implementation, and testing.

**Q: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**

A: Computer scientists develop technologies and solutions through programming, data analysis, and system design, which are crucial for innovation and solving complex problems. The work on this project helps Grazioso Salvare to efficiently access and interact with their data, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions and streamline operations. This capability is vital for their mission-critical work in animal rescue and contributes significantly to their operational success.
