        <p>
            Completing the Computer Science program has been a solid learning experience, giving me a strong foundation in software development, databases, and problem-solving with algorithms. My ePortfolio highlights the work I’ve done to improve my skills in these areas. 
            The first artifact focuses on software design, where I improved the structure of my Android Studio project to make it more modular and maintainable. The second artifact shows my ability to optimize algorithms, making data processing more efficient. 
            The third artifact is all about database integration, where I worked with SQLite and MPAndroidChart to store and visualize weight tracking data. Throughout the program, I’ve picked up valuable experience with Git and GitHub for version control, handling team workflows, and managing code effectively. 
            Communicating technical concepts clearly—whether through documentation, reports, or discussions—has also been a key skill I’ve developed. My coursework reinforced my understanding of data structures, algorithm performance, and database best practices, including query optimization and security measures
            like input validation. Security considerations were a common theme across multiple projects, pushing me to think more critically about protecting data and preventing vulnerabilities. Moving forward, I plan to apply these skills in backend development, cloud computing, and scalable systems, with a focus 
            on efficiency and security. This program has set me up with the knowledge and problem-solving skills to contribute in the industry, and my ePortfolio reflects the progress I’ve made along the way.
